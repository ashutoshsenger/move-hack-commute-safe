# move-hack-commute-safe
It is a multi-page web app which helps users to commute safely to his destination by choosing the route from a list of
routes which has the least no. of accident hotspots and taking precautions alert while driving near an accident hotspot.
It is built in vanilla script.
Used Goggle map api to show various positions on map and geolocation for fetching current location of the
commuter.
I also implement a place suggestions features while an user enters the starting and final locations on my web app
